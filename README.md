## Space resolved discrete Fourier transform for Ubermag drive object.
- `./src/rfft_func.py` contains the `rfft` function that returns an `xarray.DataArray` object corresponding to the Fourier transform of the drive object.
- `Spatially Resolved FFT Ubermag.ipynb` contains the code description and use exaple of the `rfft` function.

**Note:** `data` folder contains simulation data and it is round about 1.3 GB. To download the data, use `git lfs pull`.
